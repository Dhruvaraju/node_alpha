What is node?
- Node js or node is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing Javascript code outside browser.

Advantages of node as of 2019
- Build twice as fast with fewer people
- 33% fewer lines of code
- 40% fewer files
- 2x requests for second
- 35% faster response time

Node Architecture 
- Prior to node javascript were run in browser which do not have access to file system or to make any server calls
- Browers uses javascript engines to convert code to machine readable code
    - Internet explorer and edge have Chakra
    - Firefox have spidermonkey
    - google chrome have V8 (Fastest javascript engine atpresent)
- Ryan Dhal took V8 engine and embedded it in a c++ program we call it node now.
- Node enables java script to access file systems and make server calls etc 
- The base object for javascript in a browser is window or document
- The base object in node is global
- Node applications are asynchronous by default, a single thread is used to monitor event queue which will have details of all
  requests. If data is ready for a request it will be available in event queue, node monitors eventqueue and processes the request.
- Use Node for I/O intense applications like data transfering and network.
- Do not use node for CPU intense operations.

Creating first app
- Create a function to console log a text and invokeit see file initial app
- log window and global objects to see if they work.
